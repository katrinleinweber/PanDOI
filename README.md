======

PanDOI is a Handle URI Resolver. It works as Windows Desktop Gadget on Windows Vista and higher or as a Widget for the Apple OS X Dashboard. PanDOI resolves persistent identifiers like Digital Object Identifier (DOI), Handel (hdl), Uniform Resource Name (URN), and sRef IDs. It is possible to open a PANGAEA dataset by its ID, to show the latest PANGAEA datasets, and to search through PANGAEA.
